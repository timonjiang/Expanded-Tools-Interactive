<h1>3 Favorite Websites or Personal Project and Why</h1>

<h2>Timon (gerund+adjective+noun) </h2>

<p>The design of the web page represents the creativity and entertaining spirit of the studio as a design consultancy. Viewers navigate the web page by the special design of the mouse and feel like in the interstellar game. The design also plays with the pixel graphics element to enhance the entertaining feeling. I can find surprise details and ideas when interacting with the website. The website itself is a design project, and it feels fun to explore the work by the studio in this way.</p>

<p>The website is like the showroom or exhibition of the designer as a product designer. It visualizes the basic simple idea of putting everything projects on the table. The one-frame animation shows as a hint of the opening of the project when I move the mouse onto the images of the product.</p>

<p>The design of the website works well as an integral part with the works. The colorful blocks look simple and neat. It strongly reflects the personal visual language of the illustrator, and give the overall impression at the first glance. It shows an example of how to combine web design and projects successfully.</p>
